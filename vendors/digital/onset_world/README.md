OMG Note: Slightly modified to add gamemode dimensions to maps made with sandbox editor

#### Description
This simple and lightweight package loads your world.json file on server start, this is supposed to be used with my sandbox editor which will save to world.json then when you no longer want the editor but still want the world loaded you use this package.<br/>
**Please disable the sandbox package before enabling this!**

#### Installation
Create a folder inside your servers package folder called world, download all files from this repository and place them inside the world folder.
Edit your server_config.json to install world as a package.<br/>
**Please disable the sandbox package before enabling this!**

#### World.json
This file must be placed in the root server directory, this means the folder with server_config.json and OnsetServer.exe.
