# oulianov_casino

This is the repo containing the indefinitly paused Oulianov Casino project, designed to run multiple gamemodes on one server.

This repo is the monolithic version of the OMG framework, now that a bug is resolved in 1.1.0 of Onset
it is possible to use the benefits of the multiple packages to have a better organisation.

But it is very unlikely that I will update or maintain this repo in the long term.

It is provided for anyone that was interested in the server progress and as a testimony of the works we put into Onset.

No support will *ever* be given for this package.

Special thanks to all the ppl I met during my Onset adventures and that helped build this begining of a framework.

 - Synyster for the Casino custom models
 - Kemro for the models and the maps of the TDM
 - SalsiTV for the awesome alien_attack map
 - OGK TeamMates with whom we had so much fun coding GG together
 
 Please note that this gamemode includes works from a lot a third parties listed above,
 while they gave their express approval for their works to be used on the server, no guarantee is given on their approval for the use
 on orther servers
